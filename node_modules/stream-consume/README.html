<h1>stream-consume</h1>
<p>A node module ensures a Readable stream continues flowing if it's not piped to
another destination.</p>
<pre><code>npm install stream-consume
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Simply pass a stream to <code>stream-consume</code>.
Both legacy streams and streams2 are supported.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> consume = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'stream-consume'</span>);

consume(readableStream);
</code></pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Only Readable streams are processed (as determined by presence of <code>readable</code>
property and a <code>resume</code> property that is a function). If called with anything
else, it's a NOP.</p>
<p>For a streams2 stream (as determined by presence of a <code>_readableState</code>
property), nothing is done if the stream has already been piped to at least
one other destination.</p>
<p><code>resume()</code> is used to cause the stream to continue flowing.</p>
